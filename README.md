## Introduction

2048 is game where you combine numbered tiles to get higher number tiles.

## Rules:

-   Combine blocks using the 4 direction arrows on your keyboard \(up, right, down, left).
-   Adjacent blocks with the same number get added up while moving
-   On every move a new block with either the number 2 or 4 is added
-   If the blocks are all filled and there are no adjacent blocks that can be combined, the game will be lost.
-   Objective is to get a block with the number 2048

## About Development

This is a 2048 game I made using html-css for design and javascript for interactivity.

I wrote all the app logic in app.js because I didn't think it would take alot :D but if I were to add the new features or make another game, I'll make much more extensive use of modules.

I'm hoping to keep improving this project and add some features I personally thought of.

The features to be implemented are below:

### Feature task-list:

1. History of moves
2. Replay functionality
3. Undo functionality
4. History of top scores on local storage or as a cookie
5. Special blocks and etc...
